# Python Tkinter Vending Machine Simulation
----------
Welcome to the Python Tkinter Vending Machine Simulation! üçèüçåüçä

##Overview
This project simulates the operation of a real-world vending machine where users can select and purchase fruits. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library, allowing users to interact with the vending machine easily.
